# Machine Learning Application to Disciplinary Action: Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation

#### ABSTRACT
To this day, the criminalization of students has contributed to the School-to-Prison-Pipeline (STPP), which is responsible for maintaining the prison population in America. This issue stems from a tendency to discipline students in ways that are not conducive to their educational and behavioral development. Within this unfortunate phenomenon there is great disproportionality in how students are being disciplined through suspensions, expulsions, and even arrests. This has become a point of emphasis for committees in Evansville, Indiana, since it was determined in 1999 that there was a need for the Evansville Commission on the Social Status of African-American Males. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data mining and machine learning techniques that can be applied to the research surrounding the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation (EVSC) to predict potential events of disciplinary action. This is meant to be used to determine which students are best suited to be enrolled in programs that serve as an alternative to suspension and expulsion. The model focuses on the following variables: school, grade, gender, ethnicity, free lunch status, primary exceptionality, reason for expulsion or suspension, and reason for arrest. The best performance, which had a precision score of 0.6948, was produced using the smote oversampling technique with a Linear SVC Classifier. Finally, the results were reviewed and propositions for further experimentation and research in the future was suggested.
