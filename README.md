# Machine Learning Application to Disciplinary Action: Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation

#### ABSTRACT
To this day, the criminalization of students has attributed to the School-to-Prison-Pipeline (STPP), which has served as a major contributor to the continually increasing prison population in America. This issue stems from a tendency to discipline students in ways that are not conducive to their educational and behavioral development. Within this unfortunate phenomenon there is great disproportionality in how students are being disciplined through suspensions, expulsions, and even arrests. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data mining and machine learning techniques that can be applied to predict which factors contribute to a likelihood of experiencing a particular type of disciplinary action. The model focuses on the following variables: school, grade, gender, ethnicity, free lunch status, primary exceptionality, reason for expulsion or suspension, and reason for arrest. The best F1 Score, which was 0.6572, was produced using SMOTE as the over-sampling tool and Linear SVC as the classifier. This model produced an accuracy of 77%. Finally, the results were reviewed and propositions for further experimentation and research in the future was suggested.
